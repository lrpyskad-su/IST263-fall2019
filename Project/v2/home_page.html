                <h2>Travel Cayman</h2>
                <p>
                    Grand Cayman is one of the three Cayman Islands that sit 150 miles south of Cuba. It is full of resorts with all-inclusive options, while the less-traveled Cayman Brac and Little Cayman have some of the best diving in the Carribbean. The best time to visit Grand Cayman is between March and June when hotel rates drop. However, the islands are warm year-round with average highs in the 80s. Grand Cayman has it all from an abundance of activities and experiences making it the perfect holiday choice for everyone, whether its a family adventure, a romantic escape, a culinary journey of a diving expedition.

                <h3>About the Author</h3>
                <p>I remember the first time my parents visited Grand Cayman simply because of a suggestion from a friend, and how they returned home saying that if we won the lottery, the family would buy a large vacation home on Starfish Point. A few years later the dreams of winning the lottery were deemed unrealistic and my parents decided to buy a house on the East End of the island to become our new happy place. I have grown up visiting the Cayman Islands multiple times a year. This being said, I have a lot of recommendations and travel experience within the country.</p>
